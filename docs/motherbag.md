Mother bag is the packaging used to keep the meat longer in the backroom from delivery. Most packages of meat come in a 4-pack mother bag, with exceptions like pork which may have several bags per container. The bags are sealed with gas. When the mother bag is cut open all contents need to be dated and sent to the shelf. The mother bag itself has a best by date as well.

The alternative to the mother bag system is just having an actual butcher to prepare each package by hand. If there is another delivery system for pre-packaged meats I am just not familiar with it.

Say you are picking in the meat department. Fresh is designed to have partial case picks by default. A pick for meat would ask you to pick 1 mother bag, for example, instead of just individual packages inside. All or nothing.

It is when you realize those mother bags are considered stable for several months prior to opening.

Meat cut off site, shipped in, and then stored for weeks in the back until the gas is released is gross imo.

I understand why stores do it. It saves the need for on site butchers, but you can't tell me it doesn't alter the meat somehow. And like any other food additive, I'm sure there's a safe quantity of exposure. But that doesn't mean you can't over consume it unknowingly.

I prefer the on site butchers for custom cuts and unseasoned ground pork for homemade sausage. When given the choice, I'll always buy from a store with an actual on-site meat cutting. I think it tastes better and I don't have to worry about some unknown side effect of the mother bag system. I can check if meat is spoiling myself. I can't check if consuming mother bag meat is affecting my hormones, immune system, or gut flora.

Call me paranoid, but the amount of extra chemicals in our food is having side effects. Some we've discovered and some we haven't yet. When possible I'm trying to eat better and cleaner. Or at the least reduce things I know to be bad in larger quantities.

Am I perfect? No. Am I going vegan? No. But I am going to make an effort to control what I can in my food? Yes.

Don't get me wrong, on site butchers require competent employees with high standards for food quality/safety. If a business is cutting corners or the meat room is being mismanaged they can do some sketchy shit that can make people sick like regrinding meat so it doesn't look as old as it is, then repacking it for a later date.

If you ever want to learn about the meat industry go to a local butcher's shop. And just start talking and asking questions. People rarely don't enjoy talking about themselves. Just go when they're less busy and you'll probably get some impromptu meat cutter demos and a good lecture on what's what.

As someone who knows a trained butcher, I can tell you the secret to winning their heart is complementing their knives. You show respect for their equipment and they'll probably talk your ear off.
