Why doesn't Comcast offer symmetrical 1 Gbps service over DOCSIS 3.1?
submitted Tue Jan 25 20:37:38 2022 UTC datetime="2022-01-25T20:37:38+00:00" 2 years ago by https://old.reddit.com/user/DUNGAROO

Can someone explain to me why nearly 10 years after DOCSIS 3.1 was finalized with support for 1-2 Gbps upstream data the maximum upload speeds Comcast will support (without paying $300/month for their fiber service) is 35 Mbps?

I keep reading articles about Comcast testing DOCSIS 4.0 setups in controlled environments and this being the future of cable internet, but there already exists a DOCSIS standard that is capable of competing with Verizon/ATT's symmetrical gigabit speeds, why isn't it being used? DOCSIS 3.1 modems have been on the market for years now. Are technical limitations to DOCSIS 3.1 preventing it from being deployed as the specification was written at scale, or is this simply Comcast making a value determination that it isn't worth the extra upfront cost to build out the infrastructure necessary to deliver faster service? If the latter, why are they even bothering with DOCSIS 4.0?

Given how important upstream bandwidth has become to things like video calls and cloud backups I now factor the availability of Fios service into my housing choices. I would love to not have this constraint, but areas where only Comcast service is available I have to avoid because 35 Mbps simply isn't enough for today's applications. (Nor is the level of service that offers 35 Mbps priced competitively)

This is a very long answer but the TLDR version of it is because it wasn't feasible to do.

Long version now, so the way cable works is there is a range of spectrum that is available to be used for the various services that cable operators provide. The bulk of the available spectrum was allocated towards the actual cable TV part of the business with each station or groups of stations being allocated a slice of the pie. What ends up being left after that is 32 channels allocated to download speed and between 4-8 channels for upload depending on market and operator. The upload spectrum that is is utilized in the US at least is from 0-42mhhz range but the frequency is full of noise as its also the same range that your tv boxes, modems etc etc use to talk to Comcast and basically say let me work. There are also the OFDM channels.

Anyway for the longest time it made more sense to upgrade download speed and it was cheaper to do. In order to upgrade the upload speeds Comcast would have to make more spectrum available for the upstream. Now in 2022 there are few ways to go about that but years ago the only viable ways of doing so would have been going to all Video over IP which would require getting legacy tv subscribers off their old equipment or implementing something know as full duplex. Full duplex basically allows you to use the same frequency channel for both upload and download instead of it being a one lane highway kind of deal.

Well FDX(full duplex) was a ratified part of DOCIS 3.1 and to actually implement it would require essential going to a Node+0 model. That is what Comcast is doing today. Most cable networks go Node+3 which means you have a node then a few amps along the way. Honestly I feel like I am getting too into the weeds on the technical stuff and sorry but the point that I am trying to go for here is that from a business decision it makes more sense to just jump to DOCIS 4.0 since most of the most expensive parts that are required lead to that anyway. There is also the issue of equipment which since DOCIS 4.0 actually has full duplex as part of the native standard makes it more readily available. DOCIS 4.0 also has support for something known as extended docis which is what cable operators like Cox are opting to do instead

-- 

Thanks I appreciate the technical explanation. So if I'm interpreting what you're saying correctly, Comcast opted to skip out on many of the performance increases that came with DOCSIS 3.1 because it would have required overhauling a lot of their network to do so- running fiber closer to the customer, swapping out amplifiers and taps with new ones capable of higher splits, changing out headend equipment, and potentially replacing set top boxes with IP-based models.

...It sounds like most of those improvements are needed for a full duplex DOCSIS 4.0 deployment anyway, so this is less of an issue of technical feasibility and more of an issue of Comcast not wanting to make the infrastructure upgrades at the time.

--

No problem on the explanation but you are misunderstanding what I am saying. It's not that Comcast doesn't want to upgrade their infrastructure its that there were roadblocks that prevented it from occurring. One example would be vendors not supporting the equipment necessary at the scale necessary to do the upgrades Comcast would want to do as FDX was added on later as part of DOCIS 3.1. By the time any of it started going to scale DOCIS 4.0 was already a thing that was one the road map. So Comcast gets caught in a catch 22 were it makes sense to just do the prep work for DOCIS 4.0.

Also DOCIS 4.0 has been in the works now probably for the better part of 4 years at least. Things take a lot of time, replacing wiring out the outside poles is relatively speaking the easy part. The permitting, getting the equipment among a host of other things is the expensive and slow portion of things. Then you also have to factor in the actual consumers and the work that goes into their homes.

Comcast has already been deploying fiber throughout their network and in fact is on track to surpass CentLink in fiber miles ran putting them squally as the third largest fiber provider in the USA. AT&T being first, Verizon 2nd. This is a upgrade that is not consumer-facing but is being done just like they upgraded their network core with virtual cmts among a host of other things. One example that's not sexy to talk about would be peering agreements, or support for things like IPv6 which Verizon doesn't support. My mind is a bit foggy and I don't know how to necessary explain the complexities so just like before I am going to make a TLDR for this and hope the point gets across

TLDR; The way things panned out it wasn't feasible for cable operators like Comcast to take full advantage of DOCIS 3.1 due to a variety of factors, some of which is due to the standard of DOCIS 3.1 having addendums added at later points which caused a split in deployment among providers which also caused different approaches to be implemented. This in turn reduced the equipment needed to deploy at scale for an operator of Comcast size. By the time many of the issues were addressed DOCIS 4.0 was already becoming available and it made more sense to just leap directly to that or for some just go to FTTH with gPON. An example of an operator who is doing such an approach would be Cox where they do FTTH for urban and then they are doing extended DOCIS for more rural settings. However, Cox is essentially 1/10th the size of a Comcast

Any reason the full 200 Mbps upstream of DOCSIS 3.0 that was finalized in 2006 was never realized?

--

The 200mbps for DOCIS 3.0 was realizing but that speed needs to be shared between households and for different use cases. Just to give a example originally when FTTH was first made available with gpon we saw low speeds being offer like 25/25,50/50, and 100/100. Well gpon technically supports something like 2.5Gb on the download and 1.5 for upload of memory serves. Anywho with time despite companies like Verizon still using the same piece of tech speeds increased with time for customers. The reason is because then fiber was first rolled out Verizon was doing something like 128 households per node so that total bandwidth had to be shared. Now Verizon general does 16 houses per node. Costs came down dramatically for gpon so Verizon opted to just reduce the households per node instead of investing in later iterations of the gpon standard. Which is also why you haven’t seen Verizon offer higher than gig speeds like say what AT&T is doing right now.

In a similar vain Comcast also shares bandwidth with the current network there is a lot more download bandwidth to share and the spilts are actually worse. There may be 100 people sharing a node. So dividing up that limited upstream becomes a challenge when as covered earlier it’s not just the internet that needs to make use of it because of their other services offered. Realistically speaking at max Comcast could only offer 50mbps on the upload but they opted with 35 as they could do that more reliably and Comcast actually tends to under promise and over deliver.

By that I mean they always overprovison their speed tiers which is why you can typically see 1400/40mbps on their 1200/35mbps speed plan or close to 500/12 on their 400/10mbps plan. Verizon also does this on the tiers below gig with the 200/200 tier getting closer to 300/300 .

Verizon is now offering 2 Gbit symmetrical service in parts of NYC using NG-PON2 (40Gb/40Gb) and is expected to being rolling out 2Gb speeds to other parts of its territory later this year, also using NG-PON2. AT&T went with XG-PON which supports 10Gb/10Gb but Verizon viewed this as an interim solution, and preferred to wait for NG-PON2 for its higher speeds (40Gb symmetrical now and at least 80Gb in the future with 8 10Gb channels, or greater than 100Gb using 25Gb channels). Verizon has been rolling out NG-PON2 to support its 5G network expansion as well.

Also, Verizon is *finally* beginning to expand fiber availability, with COs being added every few days in the DC/MD/VA area. As of yesterday, APNIC showed 6.75% of Verizon's network had IPv6 support, up from around 3% at the end of April, when the upgrades began.

-- 

Yes, I have been following Verizon very closely on this specifically with the IPv6 roll out. At the time of my post I do not believe Verizon had publically announced its 2Gb service. Anywho it is exciting stuff and I am in love with my FIOs service ever since my issues got taken care of.

--

Oh, you’re right. I didn’t notice you posted nearly four months ago.

All good man

Very good information. A few things worth mentioning. There are 2 implementations of DOCSIS 4.0, there is FDX (full duplex) and there is FDD, which doesn't do echo cancellation, but extends the cable's bandwidth to 1.8 GHz and then allocates a lot of bandwidth for the upload, as much as 600+ Mhz for 6 gbps of upload.

For the FDX one, a Node+0 model is not actually required anymore because there are now FDX amplifiers. So because of this, I suspect many of the companies that were going the FDD route are now going to reconsider and go FDX, because it just gives you full flexibility and you don't have to push these really high frequencies through the cable.

So until now, to implement a DOCSIS 3.1 upstream channel, they had to adjust their splits, which requires that the entire infrastructure be updated, so that's problem #1. But problem #2 is they didn't really have the bandwidth. Even if they had moved the split higher to accommodate 500 mbps of upload or even 1 gbps, you know in 2-3 years you'd have to redo all of it again to accommodate even higher upload speeds. So it just made more sense to wait for D4.0 where you can either do full duplex up to 6 gbps upload right off the bat without sacrificing extra bandwidth, or you can use much more bandwidth on the cable.

Also consider that the vast majority of people don't care about upload (or even know what that is). 20 mbps is plenty for video conferencing, I think Zoom uses 3 mbps up on the highest quality, so for any "common" use case, you're covered. I agree with you, upload speeds on cable are atrocious, but the reality is 90% of people only care about download, as long as upload is fast enough to not be an immediately noticeable bottleneck.

So unfortunately we'll have wait another 2-3 years, then suddenly you'll start seeing symmetrical 2-3 gbps plans.

Edit: Another factor is cost vs doing fiber to the home (FTTH). Virgin Media in the UK for instance is choosing to forego DOCSIS 4.0 altogether and go straight to fiber. They estimated, it would cost them $85/household to upgrade to DOCSIS 4.0 vs. $150 to upgrade those households to fiber. They decided the extra money was worth it since you'd end up having to upgrade to fiber in the long run anyway, so they plan to have a 100% fiber network by 2028.

-- 

Comcast only has a 42mhz upstream. That will need to shift to a mid split design (fastest method) before you get much more upload.

--

Because Comcast instead of building out and upgrading infrastructure decided to pocket the money and consistently raise prices.

-- 

Not entirely true Upgrades are happening and have been happening for years. Higher upload speeds are coming, but it's not something that just takes a flip of a switch. There's a lot of equipment being upgraded, charged out, etc. There's a lot of physical line work that needs to be done first and it's happening.

--

Comcast has been offering the same speeds for the last 5 years without any systemic improvements to speed or access.

-- 

That statement is false for the last 5years Comcast raised download speeds every single year. Upload speeds also increased on the lower end plans from 3 to 5 Mbps and from 5 to 10mbps respectively.

--

550 mhz!!! That's nuts. You must be on a really old system. Not sure how they're offering gigabit then since most of the 32 downstream channels are above that, going all the way up to the low 700mhz.

--

Interesting. So are all your live tv channels streaming? We have upstream channels from 16-42 mhz and our internet channels are from 495 to 700 mhz (I forget the exact begin and end freqs). Everything from around 110 mhz to 495 are for live digital tv channels. I think as they start pushing the upstream until the midrange, they'll have to move live channels to streaming.

--

Same upload speeds, somewhat true, although they have slowly gone up. At the $40-$50 price point here's the speeds I remember:

    2004: 3mbps / 128kbps
    2006: 4mbps / 128 kbps
    2008: 6mbps / 128? 256 kbps?
    2011: 25mbps
    2015: 50mbps
    2017: 75mbps / 5 mbps
    2018: 100mbps / 5 mbps
    2019: 150mbps / 5 mbps
    2020: 600mbps / 15 mbps
    2021: 800mbps / 15 mbps
    Late 2021/2022: 900mbps / 20mbps

I'm now probably even paying less than I was in earlier years now that I know to bug retentions every year, but where upload speeds used to be like 128kbps-256kbps in those early days I cited, I have 80


--

Curious what your approach is when contacting retentions?

Planning to call, but unsure if I am going the “this is what I am looking for, or I will cancel” or the “do you have any deals” approach

Fiber can typically carry higher upload speeds to match the capabilities of current generation modems/routers. Comcast uses a coax connection so even though they can get pretty respectable download speeds with coax, upload is extremely limited. Their rentals for modem/routers are 3.1 Docsis, at least the XB7 is currently. They would basically need to uproot all their existing infrastructure and replace with fiber, which is extremely costly, their expensive plan that’s 3Gb/3Gb is an actual fiber connection so they are replacing your infrastructure with fiber to replace the coax connections they have in place. For example in my area, att is still using dsl, which is worst than even cable or coax connections. So for my area specifically it’s an improvement. You’re paying for them to lay down that infrastructure to get that fiber, I’m not sure if they have plans to introduce that to their core customer base yet, only time will tell. I’m sure eventually they will though, or otherwise it’ll be hard to compete once fiber is mainstream.

--

Downvoted you because the original poster asked a very specific question about DOCSIS 3.1 and why Comcast isn’t leveraging its full capabilities to get higher upstream speeds over coax.

--

I did answer that by saying that cost and time is the main factor why they haven’t.

--

You said it would have to be fiber to provide gigabit upstream speeds, which is false.

--

I didn’t even say that though, I said that their current symmetrical plan uses fiber. Also Comcast has stated that to increase the upload speeds they would have to use a combination of a fiber connection with their current coax infrastructure. So they would still need to basically revamp that infrastructure. … a quote from the company, Comcast said its symmetrical 1.25Gbps trial required an "advanced architecture" that includes "software-powered networking technologies, including digital fiber optics, 'Remote PHY' digital nodes, and a cloud-based, virtualized cable modem termination system platform (vCMTS)." Source: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/comcast-says-gigabit-downloads-and-uploads-are-now-possible-over-cable/?amp=1

-- 

Also the only other thing I said about fiber was that fiber can have higher upload speeds than coax potentially, it’s a more up to date technology. Didn’t say that coax wasn’t capable of reaching some of those speeds. But it’s still limited in comparison to straight fiber.

--

I re-read your post and it only mentions time and cost in the context of upgrading to fiber. The original question is not about fiber. I downvoted your response and upvoted others that I believe answer the original question with relevant information. I commented as to why as a courtesy and not to engage in an argument.

--

Well don’t lie about the information I did provide.

--

I’ve heard att is working on a 2 gig plan. I would imagine/hoping that there prices would be a lot more affordable and without the silly construction coast that can sometimes occur with the gig pro plan because they already use fiber. I had Comcast for many years (15 years) always with the top tier internet and as soon as ATT fiber was available I left and OMG does the family notice the difference. I would have jump on the gig pro plan tho if it was available in my area because I receive my internet from a telephone pole from the alley so I don’t think i would had much of a “set up” fee.

--

2 gig and 5 gig went live in 70 cities for att yesterday. Im now pulling 3 gb down 1.5 up on wifi and true 5/5 wired.

--

AT&T is spooling up 2 gig and 5 gig symmetrical where I live much cheaper than Comcast’s best speed. No install fee. I imagine CC will be upgrading their infrastructure fast in places where AT&T will beat them up, leaving other folks stuck with no options with minimal upgrades for the immediate future.

--

If they weren’t intimidated to move when Verizon’s 940/880 Mbps service went live 10+ years ago why do you think they’ll care now? I just wish more consumers understood the value of having faster upload speeds, enough to put pressure on their elective representatives to incentivize competitors to build out in their respective markets with modern day infrastructure, not “the best we can do right now with 30+ YO technology”. Comcast should have put a plan to upgrade their network to FTTH in place decades ago, they deserve every customer who leaves for greener pastures. I pay $39.99 for 300/300 Mbps Fios service and that’s not even the “you have to call and threaten to cancel every 12 months” promotional price, that is the BASE PRICE that Verizon is now charging for their symmetrical 300 Mbps service.

--

Verizon didn't begin offering 940/880Mb service until April 2017. I know because I ordered it the day it became available, and still have the email. However, they tested 750 Mb service for a while before that. Prior to that, 500 Mb was the fastest plan, and it was very expensive ($200/month+ IIRC).

--

Interesting. You do appear correct. I first subscribed to Fios in 2017, prior to that I never had access to the service. I must have been confusing Fios and Google fiber’s offerings.

So Verizon is as 10 years ahead of most of the cable industry in delivering high-bandwidth upload options instead of 20. Google fiber and AT&T on the other hand…

-- 

Per Wiki, AT&T didn’t offer gigabit fiber until 2014, and it was a very limited rollout. AT&T expanded significantly into 84 cities in 2019.

FiOS has offered 500/500 since July 2014 (Asymmetric 500 began July 2013), and expanded to 750/750 in Jan 2017, before rolling out 940/880 to their entire footprint in April 2017. The more important point is that as of July 2014, all FiOS plans offered symmetrical speeds, something cable companies still can’t offer.

Google Fiber did indeed offer symmetrical gigabit speeds much earlier, with Kansas City receiving it in Dec 2012, and additional cities coming online in 2013. However, Google Fiber was always tiny. By 2016, they only had 640K customers and they stopped expanding the following year. Verizon has around 6.6M FiOS broadband customers (offered to 15M premises). AT&T has 6.3M fiber customers, with availability at 17M premises, and it’s expanding pretty rapidly.

--

For years in my city, Comcast has used the Gigabit Pro service to boast that they had the “fastest” internet even though most customers couldn’t even install it at their residence let alone afford the install fee and eye watering monthly bill. When Google Fiber came, Comcast had to compete in price but only at the addresses that had access to both (or AT&T fiber). When Google went to 2 Gb service, Comcast provisioned the Gig Pro customers to 3 gigs. Now AT&T is offering 5 gig service at a 40% cheaper cost and a nominal install fee. The good news for many is that AT&T fiber is available for many more residential homes in my city than Google Fiber ever was. The problem for me of course is that my home is not one of them. AT&T has legacy rights in our HOA to dig out the old copper and replace it with a fiber backbone but have not done it. Ironically, Comcast did just that a few years ago which means I can get Gigabit Pro if I wanted to stomach the cost but I can’t get AT&T or Google even though both have infrastructure within easy walking distance to my neighborhood.

--

"set up fee" Xfinity is crazy I also get my internet from the pole behind my house and requested Pro. Xfinity response was 14k in construction cost because I was 100 yards away from the nearest mod. I also can't get fiber from att because att haven't got the fiber landed on my block but every other block I check through their web site has fiber available. So frustrating!

--

Wow 😯 and here I was thinking it would be that much because they wouldn’t have to trench any lines.

https://www.fiercetelecom.com/financial/comcast-notches-record-q2-broadband-adds-354-000

If I’m reading the 2nd article right, that’s billions of dollars a year in capex upgrading network.

Mid split doesn’t necessarily mean gig+ symmetric speeds, but it does double the upstream capacity on 3.0, and gives room to put an OFDMA channel with even more capacity. I believe high split is necessary for gig+ symmetric speeds on 3.1.

--

Kinda along the same path as op but specifically about LLD, If it’s a software feature introduced as early as d3.1 why don’t big cable operators just turn it on as part of the roadmap to 4.0? Wouldn’t that solve a lot of the issues that make using latency sensitive app on cable so frustrating? And I’m sure I read that all the remote phy DAA tech that’s out already supports it so why not? My node is oversubscribed and every night we have huge ping spikes, packet loss, slow up and down speeds to our node for over a year now. At least it would solve ONE problem right?

--

My guess is that not all or Comcast’s infrastructure is capable of supporting DOCSIS 3.1’s modulation spec, even at the original lower bandwidth split.

--

But surely there’s gotta be a market out there that does, I haven’t seen any reviews from users at all.. only the live demos and “lightreading” articles about how it works and how easy it is.
